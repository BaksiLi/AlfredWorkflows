## Philosophy
This is a simple program, written for Alfred, aimed to solve probably the biggest philosophical question I met everyday: 'Should I do xxx?'. 'Should I go to the Library or just back home for sleep?'. By calling up this fanstastic app you can find out the answer. Feeling excited? Just try it now!

## Running  
The terminal version is written in Python 2, run by double-clicking it.

For Alfred user, please load the file called Should.alfredworkflow.

## Problemshooting  
- open it in terminal and if un-permitted, read this line in terminal:
> chmod +x

then paste the path of this file to it, return.

- if it is still not working, try with terminal:
> python2 

then paste the path, return. good play with it!
