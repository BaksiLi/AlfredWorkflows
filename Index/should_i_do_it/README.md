## Philosophy
This is a simple program, written for Alfred, aimed to solve probably the biggest philosophical question I met everyday: *Should I do xxx?*, *Should I go to the Library or just back home for sleep?*. By calling up this fantastic app you can find out the answer. Feeling excited? Just try it now!

## Installation
For Alfred, please double-click `Should.alfredworkflow` to load it.

The terminal version is written in Python 2.

## Troubleshooting
- open it in terminal and if no permission, read this line in terminal:
> chmod +x

then paste the path of this file to it, return.

- if it is still not working, try with terminal:
> python2 

then paste the path, return. good play with it!
