For suggestions, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/BaksiLi/AlfredWorkflows/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/BaksiLi/AlfredWorkflows/pulls).

You are more than welcomed to contribute your own creation of Alfred workflow to this list, using the following format: `[WorkflowName](link): Description`.

- WorkflowName: Omit *Alfred* in workflow name as it is implied.
- link: It should direct to the page of your workflow, either under your own repository or  the directory`Index/WorkflowName`. 
- Description: Avoid starting a description with *A* or *An*. End it with a full stop.
- Download: If applicable, attach the link of download.

Same format applies to Snippet contributions.

Thank you!
