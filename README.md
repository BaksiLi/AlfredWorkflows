# AlfredWorkflows
My own workflow creations for Alfred (or Terminal).
<sub>Most of them are Terminal friendly.</sub>
## Menu
- Should-I-do-it: A workflow aimed to solve probably the biggest philosophical question in dailylife: should I do it?
- Say-command: A workflow that allows terminal to read out something.
- Fast-ascii: A workflow that convert and paste ascii fastly.
